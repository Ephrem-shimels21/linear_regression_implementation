# linear_regression_implementation

## <div class = "alert alert-block alert-info"> I evaluated the model on two distinct datasets: the Diabetes dataset and the California Housing dataset. Notably, the model exhibited strong performance on the California dataset but relatively lower performance on the Diabetes dataset. This implementation highlights that linear regression excels when the relationship between features and the target variable is linear. Conversely, its performance tends to diminish when dealing with datasets characterized by a non-linear relationship between features and the target variable. </div>
